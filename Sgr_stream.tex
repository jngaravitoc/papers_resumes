Some characteristics

\begin{itemize}
\item First observed by Ibata 94
\item Large population of young relatively metal rich Sgr M-giant wrapping 360
across the sky  (Majewski 03)
\item debris streamer continues through the North Galactic Pole passes over the 
solar neighborhood toward the galactic anitcenter. (Belokurov 06)
\item Evolution in metallicity distribution function.

\textbf{Goal:Reproduce the angular position and distances, radial velocities of 
the tidal debrin in the Sgr leadin arm } 


\citep{Vera13} study a dark matter halo that is oblate in the center
 and triaxial in the outskirts. 

This study is motivated by expectations that the disk would modify the 

The motivations are that the disk is expected
 to modify the

 inner halo shape towards one that is oblate, in which case disk stability 
is ensured.  

also if the
halo is oblate at the inner the disk stability is ensured. 

They
argue that the triaxial halo configuration of \citep{Law10} it's
not common in the LCDM model due to the small c/a ratio compared to
LCDM predictions.

*** Is this actually an issue - canâ€™t the MW be an outlier?   
***  How much of an outlier is the Law model vs average properties


They integrate orbits of test particles in the potential Eq.\ref{eq:vera} for a period
of 2gyr backwards and forwards. 

For every test particle they select 10 random locations 
in its orbit and store the position and velocity. 
orbit of this test particle from which they have positions and velocities.

 With this methodology they reproduce observables that might be compared with 
the Sgr stream.

The results from this numerical experiment is that 

They find  a good fit in some
parts of the orbits (see Fig.2 of that paper) and that the fit does not depend
strongly on the parameter $r_a$ of the halo potential.

In the second part of this paper they study the effect of torques in the Sgr
stream. The authors argue that there are two torques, one from the triaxiality
of the halo itself and the other due to the LMC. Interestingly, the major
axis of the triaxial potential in \citep{Law10} is in the direction towards
 the LMC. They studied the magnitude of both torques and found that both
have an equal effect on the Sgr stream.

As a result, they modify the parameters of the halo model in order to account
for the additional torque of the LMC, these new parameters are now more consistent
 with those expected from the LCDM model. For the orbit integration they also take
into account the potential of the LMC. With these considerations, they find a better fit for  the Sgr
stream (see Fig.5 of that paper).
